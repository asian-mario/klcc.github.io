                      <p class="descriptor">
                        The Crockford Hotel Genting has long been a haven for the wealthy, but tonight it hides dark secrets. An extravagant invitation to a party has drawn together a circle of friends across the country, each with their own hidden agenda. Just as the night begins, a chilling announcement interrupts celebrations: the owner has been found dead in a mystery location in the hotel, captured with an antique weapon plunged into their chest. With trust shattered and alibis crumbling, it’s a race against time to piece together the clues and expose the killer lurking in plain sight. In addition, all alive members of the party have been brainwashed and have no recollection of the past whatsoever, except for the killer. It is your duty to help your mission guide identify the essential details in order to complete the mission. However, you are aided with minimal instructions. <br><br>
                        As whispers of betrayal and secrets hover around the room, you are sent into a world of deception. Each suspect has their own motives and everyone has something to hide. Specifically, the police have called you to solve this mission and it's up to you to save the day to discover and unravel all unknown aspects of the mystery. <br><br>
                        In this competitive murder mystery round, you must gather clues, analyse suspects, and unravel the tangled web of mysteries. Can you identify the victim, the place of the murder, the weapon, and the killer before the end of the 2 hours or will the killer ravage on? The clock is ticking—are you ready to put the pieces together to solve the mystery? Good Luck!

                      <h4 style="padding-top: 1.2rem; padding-bottom: 1rem;">Question Overview</h4>
                      <p class="descriptor">First up, in the evening, you have been tasked with identifying the killer from the data set. Based on the information given, conclude how many potential suspects lie in the given data set. (information provided is blood type, eye colour, hair colour and location of first sighting)<br><br>
                        An innocent passerby captured an individual with blood stains rushing hastily towards the parking staircase with blood dripping onto the carpet floor. A local biologist takes samples of the blood stains and returns to his lab attempting to unravel the blood type of the suspect along with the victim. He concludes that 2 of his samples suggest that the Blood Type is undiscovered and is represented in integer form. Additionally, when inquired by security, the innocent passerby states in a hurrying manner ‘ In the corner of my eye, I caught a glimpse of a person. They had bright blue eyes and long blonde hair and I caught sight of him at the banquet hall initially’.

                        Output: 
                        <br>
                        i) For each test case, your mission guide has told you to output a single line containing 
                        <strong>Case (A): B1, B2 , B3, ….. BQ</strong>, whereby <strong>A</strong> is the test case number that begins from 1, and <strong>yi</strong> is the answer to the i-th query in the input.
                        <br><br>
                        ii) To determine the blood type code, calculate the sum of all digits in <strong>Case Test 6</strong>.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Hint:</strong> A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters that appears within another string, maintaining the same order of characters.
                        <br><br>
                        However, due to the complex nature of the mission, your mission guide has informed you that there are numerous limits to be followed.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Limits:</strong>
                        <br>
                        – T is greater than or equal to 1 but less than or equal to 100 
                        <br>
                        – Pi is greater than or equal to 1 but less than or equal to the length of X 
                        <br>
                        – Si is greater than or equal to 1 but less than or equal to the length of Y
